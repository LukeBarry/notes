Central tendency
mean = average
median = middle
mode = most pingged

range =  1700-600 PSSA
variance = How far are values in a set are from the mean
standard deviation = How far values in a set are from the mean... square root of the variance
relative variability = the standard deviation divided by the mean
simple ranking: when the data are ordered in some way, the rank of a data point is simply its position in that order.
percentile ranking: the percent of data points that are below a data point.
z-score: the number of standard deviations that a data point is from the mean. 
    The z-score of a data point is equal to the value x minus the mean, divided by the standard deviation.
event is the outcome of an experiment
experiment, in probability, is a test to see what the outcome will be if you do something
Probability is a mathematical statement about how likely an event is to occur
independent: if the likelihood that one event will occur is unaffected by the outcome of the other event
dependent: the likelihood that one event will occurhttps://tf-curricula-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/curricula/b04b6f653b9d364d5612ac767527458a/DATA-001/v2/assets2/2.1.2_Probability_Overview/normal_distribution.png is affected by the outcome of the other event
random variable is a function that associates a real number, x, with the outcome of an experiment, and it's usually denoted by X
expected value of a random variable is a probability-weighted average of possible outcomes for that variable
A probability distribution maps all the possible values of a random variable to their corresponding probabilities
A histogram is a graphical representation of the frequencies of a random variable, 
    e.g., how many times the random variable is equal to some real number x
hypothesis testing. A hypothesis is a proposed explanation, usually made on the basis of limited evidence
    For a hypothesis to be considered a scientific hypothesis, it must be testable
null hypothesis is the hypothesis that no relationship exists between two things
alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis other than the null hypothesis
    You test the null hypothesis in the following way:
        Determine the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
        Collect the appropriate sample.
        Use measurements from the sample to determine the likelihood of the null hypothesis.
the Chi Square test is appropriate for categorical variables
while the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test is better for continuous variables
statistically significant if it's unlikely to have occurred by chance; common practice to set this threshold at 5%
